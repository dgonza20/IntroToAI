This project displays a path finding algorithm on a 15x15 board.

The user can choose to randomly select the starting position and end postion, or manually choose the two. Randomly placed blockers populated the board from there my implementation of A* is performed to pick the shorest path between the goal node and starting node. Once a path has been determined the path is displayed.
